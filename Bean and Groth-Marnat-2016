Bean, A., Groth-Marnat, G. (2016). Video Gamers and Personality: A Five-Factor Model to Understand Game Playing Style. Psychology of Popular Media Culture, 5(1),27-38.

Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) explored the relationship between video game players (gamers) personality traits and the choices that they make when developing virtual characters in the current most popular Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game: World of Warcraft. The authors provided as motivation for their experiment the lack of research on the potential impact of personality factors on gaming despite the fact that the activity continues to rise in popularity as a recreational activity. Additionally, they pointed to the popular assertion that exposure to violent videogames may be associated with violence in chilren and adolescents with particular focus on the question of whether video gamers tend to exhibit different personality traits from the rest of the population. The experiment presented by Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) aimed to explore specifically the relationship between the factors of the Big Five Inventory (BFI) personality measure and the following aspects of character development in WoW: character race, class, specialization, and faction (see https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/ for details of available choices). Additionally, they explored the relationship between personality and player's biological sex as well as preferred play style (player-versus-player, player-versus-environment, role-playing). Although other more sensitive personality measures may exist, Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) note that the high reliability and convergent validity of the BFI as well as its ability to be administered online made it an appropriate choice for their collection methods. 

Results of statistical analyses run on personality and survey data collected from 1,210 participants showed that the BFI only meaningfully provided predictive power regarding gamers' play style, and not race, class, specialization, or faction. Interestingly, Extraversion was found to be highest for participants who preferred player-versus-player interaction as opposed to role-playing which relies heavily on player-player social interaction. Similarly, Neuroticism was found to be highest for participants who preferred role-playing which may point to some desire of those individuals to exert control over the way that they are perceived in the virtual world of WoW. Bean and Groth-Marnat (2016) also present tangential findings confirming the tendency for females to exhibit higher Agreeableness, Neuroticism, and Openness. Perhaps one of the more interesting results of the experiment was that WoW players were not found to differ significantly from a non-player population along any of the BFI factors; that is important in the context of the question of video games and violence because it would seem that if there is any credibility to the claim, it must be driven by the games themselves and not the sorts of individuals who play them. 

The findings of Bean and Gorth-Marnat (2016) may suggest that a BFI model may not be appropriate for predicting a wide spectrum of outcomes, such as choice of character class (14 options), but can serve to illustrate differences on more clearly defined scales as indicated by the findings related to play-style (3 options). The lack of findings regarding faction (2 options) may seem to disagree with that claim; however, faction choices determine nuanced aspects of gameplay in WoW which are less likely to be impacted by personality than the other factors investigated. Future research should more concretely establish why personality factors may be expected to predict payer's choices regarding their character development, and hone in on more concrete spectrums within the factors that may be relevant. Race, for example, may have not been predicted by the BFI model because of the number and variety available whereas a further classification such as "human-like race" (such as elves, gnomes, or dwarves) or "monster race" (such as orc, worgen, or tauren) may be predictable given player's personalities. 



Notes/Quotes: 

- This article will attempt to build on the current literature of video games and expand it by examining personality elements of WoW and its players
- the act of playing video games has become one of the fastest growing recreational activities (Gentile 7 Anderson, 2003; Olson, 2010). 
- Bartle (1996, 2004) taxonomy: Killers, Achievers, Socializers, Explorers
- Yee (2006) showed that the taxonomy did have some similarities to researched factors but that more work was needed
- It is currently unclear what factors lead to player's choices when developing a character in WoW
- Current research on WoW has focused on economics (Rea, 2008), teamwork (Meijer, 2012), and "modding" the game (changing compoter scripts for easier game play; Read, 2008) 
- The present study was designed to address the research gap regarding which personality elements, if any, are involved in the choice of characters played in MMORPGs and video game play style
- General exploratory hypotheses: Player personality will impact main character choice (class, race) and specializations (tank, healer, damage) as well as playing styles (PVP, PVE, RP).
- Hypothesize that there will be a general difference between BFI outcomes for WoW players versus normed populace 
- BFI is a self-report inventory composed of 44 statements presented on a five-point Likert scale ranging from disagree strongly to agree strongly broadly assessing: openness to experience (inventive/curious vs consistent/cautious), conscientiousness (efficient/organized vs easygoing/careless), extraversion (outgoing/energetic vs solitary/reserved), agreeableness (friendly/compassionate vs cold/unkind), and neuroticism (sensitive/nervous vs secure/confident).
- Rammstedt and John (2007) reported high test-retest reliability and convergent validity
- This study also gathered age, gender, race, and educational status as well as video game playing and preferences: preferred style of play, how many years the participant had played WoW, character specialization, faction played, average hours and days per week played, character race and class, gender of character, character level, and virtual server played on. 
- This study solicited participants from a variety of online locations including WoW forums, online forums, in-game messaging, and participant referral. A total of 1,349 participants responded, and 1,210 were included in the study. 
- At the end of the survey they had the option of having their personality results emailed to them and, if requested, study results
- a total of ten t tests were used to examine personality difference among gender and faction (alpha adjusted to .005). a one-way between groups MANOVA was performed to investigate personality differences in play styles, character race and class, and specialization of the character. The five internal scales of the BFI were used as dependent variables, the independent variables were play styles, specialization of character, gamer's character race, and gamer's character class. Pillai's trace was used. 
- Independent samples t-testeswere conducted to compare the personality scores for gender and faction choice. Females scored statistically higher on the personality dimensions of agreeableness, neuroticism, and openness when compared to male participants. 
- The MANOVA results showed support for a relationship between playing style and BFI factors, but not for specialization of character, character class, or character race. 
- An inspection of the mean scores indicated that individuals who played primarily as PVP had statistically higher mean scores than RP for extraversion, PVE had statistically higher mean scores than PVP and RP for conscientiousness, RP had statistically higher mean scores than PVP and PVE for neuroticism, and RP had statistically higher mean scores than PVP and PVE for openness. An inspection of the univariate table showed statistical significance in all four areas of personality suggested above, but also in agreeableness for RP when compared with PVE (see Table 3).
- WoW players do not usually fit the characteristics of antisocial personality (ow conscientiousness, low agreeableness, and high neuroticism) 
- WoW players overall appear to have average levels of conscientiousness, agreeableness, openness to experience, extraversion, and to be slightly less neurotic than the overall population. 
- Consistent with previous research, female scores on the BFI were higher in openness, agreeablness, and neuroticism when compared with males (Costa, Terracciano, & McCrae, 2001; Schmitt, Realo, Voracek, & Allik, 2008) 
- PVP players may not have as wide interests and may not seek out new and novel experiences within the game or rely as heavily on interpersonal connections as other players (Atkinson et. al, 2000; McCraw, Harwood, & Kelly, 2011).
